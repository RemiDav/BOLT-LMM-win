# BOLT-LMM for Windows
Windows implementation of BOLT-LMM by Po-Ru Loh using MinGW

Compiled with MinGW on a i7-8750H

Libraries used: OpenBLAS 0.3.7.dev.a 2019-07-24 (Compiled for Sandybridge), nlopt 2.6.1, boost 1.70.0

BOLT-LMM is a fantastic tool for Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) written by Po-Ru Loh. The original version is [available here](https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/BOLT-LMM/). Since it is originally written for Linux I had to modify some part of the code to make it compile with MinGW and run it on Windows.

If you run into errors, try installing MinGW and make sure the MinGW\bin folder is defined in your path.
